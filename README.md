### About me

* I am a **hobbyist security specialist, photographer, astrophysicist and a webdeveloper.**
* I can translate to **Russian** and **English** if needed.
* I speak 4 languages: **Russian, Serbian, English** and **German**.

> My relationship with programming languages so far can only be defined by trust and understanding - I don't trust them and they don't understand me
