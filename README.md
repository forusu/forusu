* I am an **undergraduate in corporate security, photographer, hobbyist astrophysicist and a webdeveloper.**
* I can translate to and from **Russian** and **English**.
* I speak 4 languages: **Russian, Serbian, English** and **German**, currently learning **Japanese** and **Finnish**.

> My relationship with programming languages so far can only be described by trust and understanding - I don't trust them and they don't understand me
